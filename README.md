# the_grid

This project aims to facilitate collaborative experiments in VR.

Currently the technology choices are babylon.js as main rendering engine and firebase for all conectivity features.

The aim is to implement a simple persistent VR sandbox which allows objects to be loaded and showcased to other users. The sandbox will have an emphasis on showcasing procedural objects in particular.
